# Instructions for a decent RetroPie setup (in AUD)
Here's the individual parts you need.  You can often get packs containing multiple components on eBay.

## The Pi itself ($70)
Ideally, get a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B including a case

In theory you could save some money and get a Raspberry Pi 1 but I had to overclock mine to run Sega Master System and Nintendo games.  Not much chance of running Mega drive/Super nintendo.

## MicroUSB card ($10)
At least 16GB if you want lots of games.

## Controllers ($4-$30)
You can get cheap USB replica Super Nintendo controllers on eBay including shipping for $4.  Good chance of getting cheap, unreliable, and uncomortable garbage.

I went for the iBuffalo ones that cost about $30 including shipping.  Very good quality.

## HDMI/AV cable ($1 - $100, you probably already have one)
From $1 shipped from China... or a fortune if you get one from a local shop.  If using an old TV that predates HDML, get a "3.5MM Jack to 3 RCA Male Plug".

## 240V -> Micro USB cable ($10 on ebay, you probably already have one for your phone/tablet)

## *Optional* Mini Keyboard ($20)
Having a USB keyboard is hadny when setting some stuff up.  I went with a iPazzPort wireless USB one.
